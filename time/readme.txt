time.hug is an extension with routines for keeping track of real life time changes.  The jukebox files use this to determine when songs that have been playing are over (note: in recent Hugo interpreters that support the "opcode" system, this can be done much more simply than this method).

Roodylib includes all of this in the extensions folder.
