This is an updated version of Chris Tate's conversation library (available at https://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/hugo/library/contributions/converse.zip).  If used with Roodylib, it is recommended to also use the "pretty screens" extension, especially if you are using any other contributions that make use of the status line.

For usage information, look at the comments and the included sample game.
